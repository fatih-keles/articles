# Is it getting easier? I resized my boot volume in 15 minutes!

I have a Linux virtual machine (one of many) on our cloud environment that I use for Docker experiments. I try to keep it small and clean. Inevitably at some point I couldn't fit into the initial disk space. I needed to increase storage capacity. I had options like attaching another block volume but I wanted a spacious root partition so decided to resize my boot volume.

I used to work with on premises systems most of the time in the past and to be honest so far I have asked for more resources from sysadmins countless times but I have never done this on my own. Until now! Sysadmins took care of everything within their resources. They gave it back when it is ready to use. I had no idea of what was going on and how long it takes to do such thing. Whenever I needed something I asked from sysadmins. I can say running on cloud is no different than managing your own datacenter. Except from everything is ready, almost impossible to make a mistake (unless you ignore the signs), best of the breed technology, unlimited resources (if you are willing to pay). I must say! Grow, scale, pretty easy, pretty impressive.

6 steps to achieve this:

1. I stopped the VM instance, created a clone of boot volume. Then detached it from the server and resized it to double the capacity.

2. I attached boot volume as an iSCSI Block Volume to another VM. At this point Oracle Cloud warns us to execute OS level iSCSI commands in order to extend the capacity and be able to use it.

![alt text](./resources/attach-block-volume.png "Attaching a block volume")
![alt text](./resources/attach-block-volume-warning.png "OCI reminder for running OS level commands")

3. I found the necessary iSCSI commands in 3 dots menu, the commands are ready to run, configured according to my storage instance.

4. I ssh'ed to guest OS and executed the commands below to register the new volume, configure it to survive after a reboot (I guess it was not necessary in this case), and login to storage.

**I have changed the real IP address of storage with {IP Address} in the following scripts.**

```console
(base) [root@fkeles-scrapyd-server ~]# sudo iscsiadm -m node -o new -T iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot:uefi -p {IP Address}:3260
New iSCSI node [tcp:[hw=,ip=,net_if=,iscsi_if=default] {IP Address},3260,-1 iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot:uefi] added

(base) [root@fkeles-scrapyd-server ~]# sudo iscsiadm -m node -T iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot:uefi -p {IP Address}:3260 -l

```

5. Then I had to extend the partition and grow the file system. To be honest this part is the most complex piece of work. I am not a Linux guru, I found the documentation extremely helpful.

I could see that capacity is doubled in *lsblk* command output. Now I had to handle the file system.

```
I unmounted the volume, logged out from the storage in order to safely detach it from host server.

6. And finally I detached the volume from host server and attached it back to my virtual machine. Pretty easy, with a few mouse clicks and executing some commands I was able to extend my root partition of my Linux server. Impressive.
